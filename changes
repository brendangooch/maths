v1.3.1
    added AspectRatio + tests class to library and index.ts barrel file
    adjusted typescript and package.json scripts to turn off annoying ~noUnusedLocals params whilst developing
    added load() / save() methods to Vector2D & Bezier classes

v2.0.0
    added/amended to Vector2D class:
        setXY(x: number, y: number): void - to bet both properties at once
        equals(v2: Vector2D): boolean
        setX() instead of set x()
        setY() instead of set y()
        setLength(...) instead of set length(...)
        setAngle(...) instead of set angle(...)
        addAngle(radians: number): Vector2D - add to existing angle rather than setting again
        normalise() instead of normalize()
        added method chaining to all suitable methods, which now return 'this':
            constructor()
            setX()
            setY()
            setXY()
            setLength()
            setAngle()
            addTo()
            subtractFrom()
            multiplyBy()
            divideBy()
            normalise()
            copy()


    both Bezier classes:
        <breaking changes to interface>
        removed constructor()
        removed clamp constraint on t parameter - it's possible that client wants to go over or under 1
        added setStart(v: Vector2D), setEnd(v: Vector2D), setControl/A/B(v: Vector2D), setAll(v: Vector2D) for setting points
        added efficiencies to getX()/Y() methods
            returns start vector if t === 0
            returns end vector if t === 1
            returns start vector if all points are equal
        added private calculateX/Y(t: number): number methods for style reasons
    
    Quadratic Bezier
        added setControlByDistanceAndAngleFromStart(angle: number, distance: number): void
            convenient alternative way to set control point, used by at least one client (DynamicVector)
        added makeStraight() method to instantly create a straight line between start and end
            very convenient for DynamicPosition client
    
    TESTED ALL NEW FEATURES VISUALLY + ALL TESTS UPDATED AND PASS


v3.0.0
    changed both Bezier classes to accept scalar values (x,y) instead of Vector2D objects in their set methods
    adjusted tests slightly.  All tests still pass.


v4.0.0
    added distanceBetween() to both Bezier classes, which returns the distance between start and end vector
    default start values are now 0,0
    removed makeStraight() from QuadraticBezier - why use a bezier when a vector will do?






future ideas:
    could combine both bezier classes into 1 with optional controlB
    create a "Path" class by combining a series of cubic bezier curves
